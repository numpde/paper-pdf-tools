Construct the filename for a scientific paper PDF in the format:

YYYY-Author1-Author2[-Author3] (Title).pdf

Rule 1: Year
- Extract the publication year (YYYY) as an integer.
Example:
  2024

Rule 2: Authors
- Extract full surnames for all authors.
- Remove any dashes (e.g. "Smith-Jones" → "SmithJones") and apostrophes (e.g. "O'Neil" → "ONeil").
- Return the full list of surnames as an array without truncation.
Examples:
  "Wang, Lee" → ["Wang", "Lee"]
  "Smith, Johnson, Davis" → ["Smith", "Johnson", "Davis"]
  "Wang, Gupta, Zhang, Tonekaboni, Jegelka, Jaakkola, Uhler" → ["Wang", "Gupta", "Zhang", "Tonekaboni", "Jegelka", "Jaakkola", "Uhler"]

Rule 3: Title
- Replace any colon (:) with " -- ".
- Use natural capitalization: preserve acronyms and proper nouns exactly; for other words, only the first word is capitalized.
Examples:
  "AI in Drug Discovery" → "AI in drug discovery"
  "ML: Trends" → "ML -- Trends"
  "MolGPT molecular generation using a transformer-decoder model" → "MolGPT -- Molecular generation using a transformer-decoder model"

Instructions:
Call `tool_set_filename` with these parameters:
- year: the extracted publication year (integer).
- author_name_list: the full list of surnames as an array.
- title: the processed title.
Then call `tool_finished`. If the first page content does not provide enough clear information or appears corrupt, call `tool_finished` immediately without outputting a filename. Output nothing else.

First page content:
<PDFCONTENT>{first_page_text}</PDFCONTENT>
